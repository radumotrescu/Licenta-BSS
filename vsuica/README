Implementation of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for Blind Source Separation

This folder contains:
1. src 		- All source code files
2. plot 	- plots used in the report
3. savedMats	- recoverd sound samples
4. resultCorrs	- correlation matrices of recovered samples
5. report	- the report

To do a trail sample run of the code:
1. $cd src
2. $matlab icafull.m

or (for checking with beta):
3. $matlab icafullBeta.m

The rest of the code in the src file have names that are self-explanatory and are commented sufficiently to be able to follow the algorithm.

Read report for the explanation of the algorithm, implementation details and results.
